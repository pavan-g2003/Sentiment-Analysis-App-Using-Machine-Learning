Sentiment Analysis App Using Machine Learning

A Sentiment Analysis Web Application built using Machine Learning to classify text (and optionally images) into sentiment categories such as Positive, Negative, and Neutral.
The project demonstrates an end-to-end ML pipeline including data preprocessing, model training, and web deployment.
